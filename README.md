# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking a space with either "X" or "O." The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does. If all spaces are filled and no one achieves three in a row, the game is a draw.
